== Description ==

A content locker WordPress plugin. Users are required to connect their crypto wallets to view the locked content.

= How it works? =

The plugin provides a block called METALOCKER. Just insert that block anywhere in your post. All the content below the block will be hidden completely with a callout asking users to connect their wallet. Once users connected their wallet, the hidden content will be unlocked.

Content won't be locked for logged-in users who can edit posts.
